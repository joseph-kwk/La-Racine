Here's a complete planning document for my family tree app that weaves together functionality, architecture, user experience, and long-term scalability.

🌳 Family Tree App Creation Document
Project Name (La Racine): Roots & Branches or AncesTree Purpose: A cross-platform system where users collaboratively build, view, and interact with their living and historic family tree, complete with bios, updates, notifications, and cultural richness.

🧠 Core Concept
A secure platform where authorized users:

Log in and manage family trees

Add/edit family members with images, life info, location, and updates

View and interact with trees and timelines

Receive event-based notifications (birthdays, deaths, additions)

Celebrate shared heritage with optional regional or cultural theming

👥 User Roles
Role	Capabilities
Superuser	Full access to all trees, users, audit logs, system settings
Tree Admin	Can create/edit tree structure, invite/manage contributors
Contributor	Add/edit members, biographies, updates, media
Viewer	View tree, member info, comment if allowed
🏗️ Database Structure (Django-style Models)
UserProfile
user: FK to Django user

nickname, profile_photo, current_location, birthday

Tree
id, name, created_by, created_at

FamilyMember
tree: FK

name, dob, dod (optional), photo, bio, nickname, location, parent_ids, spouse_id

is_alive: boolean

added_by

Update
member: FK to FamilyMember

content, media, created_by, timestamp

Notification
type: [Birthday, Death, Addition]

target_user, event_date, related_member

🔔 Notification System
Use Django signals or Celery tasks:

Birthday reminders (daily cron check)

Addition/death alerts via form triggers

In-app notifications + optional email

You can use channels/websockets for live alerts later.

🖥️ Frontend Features
🎯 Tree Visualization
Use React Flow or D3.js for interactive layouts

Zoom, pan, expand branches

Node click: view profile modal

📱 Profile Interaction
Add nickname, current city, life updates, story snippets

Comment or emoji reactions

Timeline view (birth, graduation, weddings, etc.)

🌍 Location Mapping
Display locations on a family map using Leaflet or Google Maps

Optional migration paths or place histories

🧰 Tech Stack Recommendations
Layer	Tools / Frameworks
Backend	Django + Django REST Framework + Celery
Frontend	React or Vue + TailwindCSS + D3 / React Flow
Database	PostgreSQL
Storage	Cloudinary or Firebase for images/videos
Deployment	Docker, Vercel (frontend), Railway/Render (backend)
Authentication	Django Allauth or JWT via Knox
Notifications	Django Signals, Celery, optionally FCM
💡 Stretch Features & Next Phases
Tree Themes: African heritage, minimalist, vintage

Audio Memories: Attach voice notes to profiles

Searchable family lineages

Event Calendar: auto-generated from member birthdays, anniversaries

Export Options: PDF/print family tree

Genogram View: for medical/social history display

🚀 Roadmap
Phase 1: MVP (2–3 months)
Auth system with user roles

Tree structure with member add/view

Profile editing & basic media upload

Birthday notifications

Phase 2: Interaction & Enrichment (3–5 months)
Update feed & comment system

Tree visualization UI

Location mapping

Invite flow & sharing

Phase 3: Scale & Polish
Admin panel for superuser

Push notifications

Theming engine

Mobile PWA wrapper (Capacitor)
